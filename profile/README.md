Check out how to watch Rangers v Celtic in the Scottish Premiership, including TV channel, radio coverage and kick-off time.
Rangers will host the first Old Firm derby of 2025 as Celtic visit Ibrox as part of Thursday's full Scottish Premiership schedule.

The Gers went winless against their fierce local rivals last year. The pair drew 3-3 in April and the Hoops came out on top in their other four meetings, which included victories in the finals of the 2023/24 Scottish FA Cup and 2024/25 Scottish League Cup.

A win for Philippe Clement's side would be their first in an Old Firm derby since May 2023 and see them cut Celtic's lofty lead at the top of the Scottish Premiership table to keep their slim hopes alive in the title race.

One of the greatest rivalries in football is set to reignite as Rangers host Celtic in the Old Firm derby in the Scottish Premiership on Thursday.

The Gers came back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Motherwell in their last league match. This result meant that they have only won one of their last three Premiership matches, and are 14 points behind league leaders Celtic.

Celtic, on the other hand, made it two wins in a row with a 4-0 rout of St Johnstone in their previous match, further strengthening their lead on the top of the table.
